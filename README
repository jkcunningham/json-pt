JSON-PT is a simple Common Lisp package for interacting with JSON
interchange format data. It consists of a decoder, an encoder and some
tests which demonstrate usage.

This package has no dependencies. 

There are several excellent JSON utilities around for Common Lisp
(see, CL-JSON and especially YASON).  I wrote this because I found the
other packages a little more difficult than I liked for representing
the structures as simple s-expressions (p-list trees). It is very
simple to use.

The file test-json.lisp contains a series of tests/examples. (Note:
the names, addresses, phone numbers, ccard numbers, etc. were randomly
generated, so don't get excited. See my FAKER package for details.)

Since this is all there is in the way of documentation, I'll mention
that setting *json-pprint* true will write the JSON output with
linefeeds and indentation which is nice if you actually need to read
one. Setting *json-debug* true writes out grotesque amounts of
information useful for debugging.

I think I've covered all the cases at http://json.org, but I stopped
worring about it once my use-case was covered.

Email me if you find any bugs, or better yet send me a pull-request
with the fix.
